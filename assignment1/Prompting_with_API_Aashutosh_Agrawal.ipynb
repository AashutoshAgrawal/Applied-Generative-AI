This is achieved by doing the inverse of each operation to both sides in order.\n\nStep 2: Start by looking at the constant term, +5.

However, it should be noted that many physicists, including Peter Higgs himself, dislike the nickname since it was actually bestowed more for marketing reasons rather than scientific ones.\n\nThe discovery of the Higgs Boson was crucial because it confirmed the Standard Model of particle physics. The existence of this particle was proposed in 1964 by British physicist Peter Higgs, among others, to explain why some particles have mass and others don't.\n\nThe job of the Higgs Boson is to give other particles their mass. In theory, particles acquire mass by passing through the \"Higgs Field\" - a field of energy that exists throughout the universe. Some particles interact more with the Higgs field than others, which gives them more mass.\n\nAll in all, the discovery of the Higgs Boson deepens our understanding of the universe's basic makeup and the laws of physics that govern it.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Observation\n\nCreative Writing Focus: The system role is set as a \"creative writing coach specializing in science fiction,\" which guides the AI to provide storytelling advice rather than technical or factual science information.\nSpecific Genre Expertise: By specifying \"science fiction\" in the system role, the AI tailors its suggestions to fit sci-fi conventions and themes, resulting in more relevant brainstorming for that genre.\nOpen-Ended User Prompt: The user asks for \"unique plot twists that haven't been overdone,\" which prompts the AI to generate multiple creative options (8 different ideas) rather than a single answer.\nCoaching Behavior: The AI response demonstrates coaching characteristics by not just listing ideas, but also providing guidance about character development and emotional impact at the end.\nPractical Application: This example shows how role-based prompting can be used for creative tasks beyond typical Q&A, demonstrating the versatility of the system role in shaping AI behavior for different domains (education, creativity, problem-solving, etc.)."],"metadata":{"id":"8yyUvbEHet0A"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["✍️ Exercise 2: Give a prompt of your choice.\n👉 Task:\nNow write your own custom prompt.
